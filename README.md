## 🎯 Mission

The Self-Care Toolkit Agent exists to support college students during moments of stress, overwhelm, and emotional uncertainty by transforming how they feel right now into clear, personalized, and practical next steps. It reduces decision fatigue, offers grounded guidance when self-care feels hard to figure out, and helps students build a flexible collection of supportive strategies they can rely on during challenging times.

Made with ❤️ for better mental health and self-care

## 🌟 What It Does

The Self-Care Toolkit AI Agent helps students:

- **Take a personalized quiz** to identify current struggles, mood, and needs
- **Receive AI-generated recommendations** tailored to their energy level and preferences
- **Save helpful strategies** to a personal toolkit for future reference
- **Get proactive suggestions** from an AI agent that learns their patterns and preferences
- **Schedule self-care time** directly in their Google Calendar
- **Create journal entries** in Google Docs with personalized prompts
- **Build a flexible collection** of supportive strategies they can rely on

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Quiz & Recommendations**: Students take a brief quiz about their current state. An AI agent generates 2-3 personalized self-care activities with step-by-step guidance.

2. **Save to Toolkit**: Students can save any recommendation to their personal toolkit for easy access later.

3. **AI Agent Suggestions**: On login, an intelligent agent analyzes the student's history, preferences, and current context (including weather) to suggest 1-2 actionable next steps:
   - Schedule dedicated time for self-care activities
   - Create a journal entry with personalized prompts
   - Retake the quiz if it's been a while

4. **Integration & Memory**: The agent remembers what works for each student, references past interactions naturally, and adapts suggestions based on what they've accepted or declined.

5. **Calendar & Journal**: Students can schedule self-care time blocks (with conflict detection) and create journal entries directly from recommendations, all integrated with Google Calendar and Google Docs.
